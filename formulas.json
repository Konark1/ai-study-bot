    "area of a square": "\nA square is a four-sided polygon that has all sides equal in length and all angles equal to 90 degrees. The area of a square can be calculated using the following formula:\n$$A = s^2$$\nwhere $s$ represents the side length of the square. This means that the area of a square is simply the square of its side length. For example, if the side length of a square is 5 units, then its area would be:\n$$A = 5^2 = 25 \\text{ square units}$$"
