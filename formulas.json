    "area of a square": "\nA square is a four-sided polygon that has all sides equal in length and all angles equal to 90 degrees. The area of a square can be calculated using the following formula:\n$$A = s^2$$\nwhere $s$ represents the side length of the square. This means that the area of a square is simply the square of its side length. For example, if the side length of a square is 5 units, then its area would be:\n$$A = 5^2 = 25 \\text{ square units}$$",
    "ohm's law": "\n\\begin{equation}\nV = IR\n$$\nOhm's Law states that the voltage (V) across a resistor is directly proportional to the current (I) flowing through it and inversely proportional to its resistance (R). The formula for Ohm's law can be written as:\n\\begin{equation}\nV = IR\n\\end{equation}\nwhere V is the voltage, I is the current, and R is the resistance. This means that if you increase the current flowing through a resistor, the voltage across it will also increase proportionally. Conversely, if you decrease the resistance of a resistor, the voltage across it will decrease proportionally while keeping the current constant.",
    "pythagoras theorem": "\n\\begin{equation*}\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n\\end{equation*}\nwhere $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the two legs of a right triangle, and $c$ is the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite to the right angle). This formula states that in any right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides."
